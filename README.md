# LightEmAll

LightEmAll is a puzzle game where players aim to light up all game pieces on a board by ensuring correct connections. Key algorithms and techniques used include:

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Utilizes Kruskal's Algorithm to connect pieces efficiently without cycles.
Random Rotation: Adds difficulty by randomly rotating game pieces.
Pathfinding: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to check if all pieces are powered and connected from the power station.
